# Brief-Introduction-to-Deep-Neural-Networks-Mathematical-Foundation
In this small report, I explain some of the underlying ideas of neural networks. 
I first briefly introduce the mathematics behind the deep learning models and then give a quick overview on 
regularization techniques. I am planning to create Pytorch implementations of the tecniques introduced in this report. 
These notebooks including several applications can be found in my repos.
